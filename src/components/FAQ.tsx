    {
      question: "How does Tensor Dynamics' AI differ from other weather models?",
      answer: "Our models uniquely combine physics-based numerical weather prediction with machine learning to achieve significantly higher accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches, our hybrid models understand the fundamental physical processes governing weather patterns, making them more reliable, especially for rare or extreme events."
    },
    {
      question: "What industries benefit most from Skycaster?",
      answer: "Skycaster is particularly valuable for industries where weather directly impacts operations and logistics, including renewable energy, cold chain logistics, food delivery services, maritime and aviation, agriculture, and consumer navigation. Any business whose operations are affected by weather conditions can benefit from our technology."
    },
    {
      question: "How is real-time data fusion achieved?",
      answer: "Our proprietary Weather Engineâ„¢ continuously ingests and processes data from multiple sources including satellite imagery, radar systems, weather stations, and IoT sensors. Advanced AI algorithms then harmonize these diverse data streams, accounting for spatial and temporal differences to create a comprehensive, real-time view of current and predicted weather conditions."
    },
    {
      question: "What level of accuracy improvement can we expect?",
      answer: "Clients typically experience 20-30% higher accuracy compared to traditional weather services or purely data-driven models. The exact improvement varies by region and use case, with the most significant gains in areas with complex terrain or rapidly changing weather patterns."
    },
    {
      question: "How easy is it to integrate Skycaster with our existing systems?",
      answer: "Skycaster offers flexible integration options through standard REST APIs, WebSockets for real-time data, and pre-built connectors for common enterprise systems. Most clients achieve full integration within 2-4 weeks, with our engineering team providing support throughout the process."
